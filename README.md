Summary of the Project AIRGEAD Banking
The Airgead Banking project was focused on solving the problem of financial management by providing users with tools to calculate and visualize their savings growth over time. 
The primary functionality involved taking user inputs such as initial investment, monthly deposits, and interest rates, then generating projections of their future savings through detailed annual reports. 
This helped users better understand how their savings could grow, helping them make informed financial decisions.

What I did well
I likely excelled in structuring the program to handle user input and generating accurate financial projections. 
This would have involved correctly applying formulas for compound interest and ensuring that the user interface was intuitive and user-friendly. 
My attention to detail in managing financial calculations and ensuring that the output was both accurate and easily interpretable would have been key strengths.

Where I Can Improve My Code
Using more efficient data structures could speed up the program, especially with larger data sets or more complex financial scenarios.
Enhancing input validation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as handling invalid or malicious user input, would make the program more robust.

Challenging Parts of the Code
The most challenging aspect might have been implementing the compound interest calculations and ensuring that the results were accurate across various scenarios. 
Overcoming this likely involved thorough testing and possibly seeking out financial formulas or resources to ensure accuracy. 
Debugging complex financial calculations can be tricky, and using tools like unit tests or financial calculators to cross-check my results would have been useful.

Transferable Skills
The skills gained from this project, such as handling user input, performing complex calculations, and generating reports, are highly transferable to other projects or coursework.

Making the Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Program
I made the program maintainable by using clear and consistent naming conventions, adding comments to explain complex sections of code, and organizing my code into logical sections or modules. 
By writing modular code, I made it easier to adapt the program to future needs, such as adding new features or changing existing ones.
